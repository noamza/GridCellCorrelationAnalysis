muscimol
_______

cluster ISI

4.1.18
smooth rate map, just add up to each bin
check removing spikes for head direction
correlate vector of b v m correlations

shuffling on spatial
paint cells by only those that recovered
standardize axis
what does residue mean???
correlate vector of cors b to m spear vs pears
ISI
temporal AUTOcorrelation
head direction - check removing spikes - plot good
check all on removing spikes
*********
___
- use spearman instead of pearson, (rank order, does not assume
gaussian) analogous to wilcox vs t-test
- make sure to specify if points not included in plot
- check why plots stop at 0 don't show negatives.
___
- GRIDSCORE SHOULD ACCOUNT FOR ACCURACY
- There are theta cells, what smoothing does that belong to?
- analyze fourier transforms
- relate smoothing to shuffling?

IIIIIIIII

//Run control: do same analysis for Before vs During, for After vs During

//Correlations: generate results as a function of different levels of
smoothing, see if there is sharp negative connectivity

//Spatial correlations: center point of cross correlation, include shuffling

//Correlations of Head Direction cells by angle ( should we really do
this? I don't see the value of this to be honest, obviously similar
angles will be more correlated, and it doesn't seem very related to
the study, I'd like to talk more ab out this one.


Discuss signal vs noise correlation - I found this attached review by
Marlene R Cohen & Adam Kohn, let me know if there are other sources to
look at.

Correct head direction by moving direction
Annotate computeMovingDirection
Correlate cells by direction
Refresh on time correlation
