TODO

X converge to which cells to use in figures : threshold or shuffling etc.

- make sure all figures use correct rm, ac, gridscore, 
  based on cross-correlation method (gilad or normxcorr2+interp2)

- change which cells are shown in figure examples so that they are 
  in the cohort and are good examples

- make sure all axes in paper have labels

- add p values to all figures with r values


PAPER
