TODO

- converge to which cells to use in figures : threshold or shuffling etc.

- make sure all figures use correct rm, ac, gridscore, based on cross-correlation method (gilad or normxcorr2+interp2)

- change which cells are shown in figure examples so that they are in the cohort and are good examples

- remove supplamentery 1 2 3

- add p values to all figures with r values

- change stats in paper
