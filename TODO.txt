TODO

X converge to which cells to use in figures : threshold or shuffling etc.

X make sure all figures use correct rm, ac, gridscore, 
  based on cross-correlation method (gilad or normxcorr2+interp2)

X change which cells are shown in figure examples so that they are 
  in the cohort and are good examples

X make sure all axes in paper have labels

X add p values to all figures with r values

X s5 change inf to end

- s6 wording change, mild relationship with gridness and correlation

- check f1 why cells in threshold not cohort

X s9 to 0.4
